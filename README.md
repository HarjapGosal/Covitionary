A resource for a standardized vocabulary of terms in the Covid domain (Covitionary)

We have been facing a challenge of our lifetimes in the form of the Covid-19 pandemic since the start of 2020. The scientists and researchers of the world are working hard to control the deadly virus and the disease. It has led to the creation of a large amount of scientific and non-scientific literature (1-4) covering the different aspects of the pandemic, such as surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, transmission, treatment drugs, and vaccines, post-treatment dynamics, to name a few. The automatic means of text-mining and standardized resources could help researchers in dealing with the overwhelming literature.
The objective of the project was to develop a resource for a standardized vocabulary of terms in the Covid-19 domain (Covitionary) by mining the literature and automatic generation of Covid terms from the text. For this, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, especially text-mining, were used and implemented in Python programming language to acquire the various terms from the text (target of 10000 terms) and organize these in a vocabulary. The Covitionary resource has currently 12184 most frequent terms used in the COVID-19 domain literature. This resource has many potential applications
